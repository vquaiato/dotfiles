# My Dotfiles

Need to change this stuff... üëáüèª

After 1 month using a brand new Macbook Pro, it started failing on me, so I had to take it to the Apple Store to then realize I'd have to reinstall everything. Again.

I decided this would be the last time I wasted so much time doing all the setup. So I remebered [Victor Cavalcante](https://github.com/vcavalcante/dotfiles)'s advice to me. He was talking about how he automated his setup using something called "dotfiles". Read about it [here](https://driesvints.com/blog/getting-started-with-dotfiles/).

After a lot of researching and investigating, I decided to use [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to do the same.

## Why Dotbot?

I wanted a simple bootstrapper with no dependencies that did only 2 things:
- Automated the creation of symlinks with some security for overwriting
- Provided a way to execute commands for things like sourcing scripts, running brew, etc.

I didn't want something much more complex than that, I almost decided I'd write my own script, but then I found out about Dotbot, which completely satisfied my requirements.
